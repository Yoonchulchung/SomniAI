# SomniAI

SomniAI helps improve your sleep quality by analyzing your sleep posture and movements, delivering personalized feedback that helps you wake up refreshed and ready to take on the day.
With higher-quality sleep, you can wake up feeling refreshed and energized to start your day.
Camera data collected through the mobile app is transmitted to a FastAPI server, where an AI model processes and analyzes the information in real time.

## MoJI
